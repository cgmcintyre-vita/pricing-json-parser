# Pricing Report Parser

Report generated from SAP CC comes in Excel format. From Products tab, filter the products you want, then export an Excel sheet with the following tabs:

1. Catalog version*^
2. Name[en]
3. Price in Json
4. Product ID*^

This package is designed to give you the tools for parsing the output report and, if necessary, printing the data into an excel sheet with the pricing in columns instead of json format.

Note - This module is currently only designed for AMER catalogs. It expects US and Canada pricing.
